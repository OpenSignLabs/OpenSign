# üîÅ Webhook

## üîî What is a Webhook?

A **webhook** allows one system (like OpenSign) to automatically send real-time data or notifications to another system (like your server) when a specific event occurs.

Think of it as a **push notification for your backend** ‚Äî instead of continuously checking for updates (polling), a webhook pushes data to your endpoint **as soon as an event happens**.

---

## üß† Simple Example

Suppose you're using OpenSign to collect eSignatures:

- When someone **signs a document**, OpenSign triggers a **POST request** to your server.
- The request includes data such as the document ID, signer email, and signature status.
- Your server can then process this information ‚Äî for example, update your CRM, trigger a workflow, or send a confirmation email.

## üß≠ How to Add a Webhook in OpenSign

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is the OpenSign Sandbox environment?

The Sandbox is a testing environment designed for developers to safely experiment with OpenSign APIs and workflows. It mirrors the live environment but with testing limitations.

---

### 2. Can I use my Live Webhook in the Sandbox?

No. **Live Webhooks do not work** in the Sandbox environment. You must configure a separate webhook specifically for Sandbox testing.

---

### 3. Can I test all webhook events in the Sandbox?

Yes. The Sandbox environment supports all event types, including `created`, `viewed`, `signed`, `completed`, and `revoked/declined`.  
However, some behaviors may be simulated for testing purposes.
