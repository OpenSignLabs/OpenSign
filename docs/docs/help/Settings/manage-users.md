## 🔁 Managing User Status

- **Activate/Deactivate Users**
  - Use the toggle in the **Active** column to enable or disable a user’s account.
  - **Deactivated users** will not be able to log in to OpenSign until reactivated.

---
## 🔁 Delete Users  

- OpenSign allows **admins** to delete users when needed.  
- Once a user is deleted, their account and all associated data are **permanently removed**. OpenSign does **not** keep deleted user records and restoration is **not possible**.  
- To delete a user:  
  1. Click the **Delete** button next to the user you want to remove.  
  2. A confirmation popup will appear.  
  3. Enter the user’s email in the input box and click **Delete**.  
- After deletion, the user (and all related data) will be permanently erased.  

> ⚡ **Note:** Once a user is deleted, your **available user count will automatically increase**.

  2. Enter the new password on the reset password screen and submit.

- The user’s password will be successfully updated, and they will no longer be able to log in using the old password.
  
## 🔁 Add API Credits

- OpenSign allows **admins to assign API credits** to team users. This feature helps control and limit how many API-based document operations a user can perform.
- A team user can only use the number of credits allocated by the admin.  
  - For example, if an admin assigns **100 API credits**, the user can perform API actions only until those 100 credits are consumed.  
  - Once credits are exhausted, the admin can add more.  
    - Example: If the admin wants to give the user 50 additional credits, they must enter the updated total — 150 credits. After updating, the user will have 50 usable credits remaining.

- **How to add API credits:**
  1. Navigate to **Settings → Users** and click the **Add Credits** button next to the user who needs add API credits.
  2. Enter the number of credits to allocate and submit.

- The user will now be able to use the assigned API credits up to the new limit.

> ⚡ **Note:** Credits can only be added if the selected user has an active API token.

**How to create an API token for a team user:**
1. Log in using the team user's email address.
2. Navigate to **Settings → API Token**.
3. Generate a live API token.

Once the API token is created, the admin can assign API credits to that user.

## 👥 Buy More Users (Buy Additional Seats)

OpenSign allows you to create users based on the number of seats included in your selected plan. For example, if your current plan includes **2 users**, you can only create **2 users** by default. To add a **third user**, you must **purchase additional seats**.

### Steps to Buy More Users

1. **Click "Buy more users"**
2. A popup titled **Add Seats** will appear.
3. **Enter Quantity** – specify how many additional users (seats) you want to purchase.
4. The **cost** will be calculated automatically based on your plan rate (e.g., USD 100 per user).
5. Click the **Proceed** button to finalize the purchase.
6. The seats will be **immediately added** to your account.

<img width="436" alt="buy-more-seats" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e093a64-1b75-4543-b4c4-1186d4c02b09"></img>

7. Once you’ve purchased additional seats, click the **"+" Add User** button to create the new user.

> 💡 **Tip:** You can also purchase additional seats in advance to avoid interruptions during user onboarding.

### 🔢 Understanding "Available Seats"

At the bottom-right of the **Users** page, you’ll see the **Available seats** status.

<img width="436" alt="seat-availability" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37c2a5c7-0d4b-4bd2-8fb1-11def9e65b42"></img>

**Example:**  
`Available seats: 2/3`

This means:
- **2 seats** are currently available for creating new users.
- **3** is the **total number of user seats** your organization has purchased.

If the available seats count is **0**, you must **buy more seats** before adding new users.

---

## 📌 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How do I pay for purchased add-on users?**  
**A:** After purchasing additional users (seats), your saved card will be charged automatically, and an invoice will be emailed to your registered address.
If no card is on saved, a payment link will be sent to your email to complete the transaction.
