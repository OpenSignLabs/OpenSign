## üß† Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What is the OpenSign Sandbox environment?**  
The Sandbox is a testing environment designed for developers to safely experiment with OpenSign APIs and workflows. It mirrors the live environment but with testing limitations.


**2. Can I upload large documents to the Sandbox?**  
No. Please avoid uploading documents larger than **5MB** in the Sandbox. It is optimized for lightweight testing only.


**3. Can I use my live API token in the Sandbox?**  
No. **Live API tokens do not work** in the Sandbox environment. You‚Äôll need to generate a separate token specific to Sandbox testing.


**4. Why can‚Äôt I use a live template in the Sandbox?**  
Live and Sandbox environments are **separate**. Templates created in the live environment cannot be used in the Sandbox, and vice versa.


**5. Can I use the API in the free self-hosted environment?**  
No. We do not support generating API tokens in the **free self-hosted version**.  
If you want to use OpenSign APIs in a self-hosted setup, you must upgrade to the **paid self-hosted plan**.
