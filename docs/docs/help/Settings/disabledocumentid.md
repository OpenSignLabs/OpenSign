# How to disable adding the OpenSign™ documentId to signed documents
Whenever a document is signed by all parties, OpenSign™ adds a DocumentId at the top left corner of the digitally signed document.
Using this id you can verifiy the authenticity of the document at a later date, hence we strongly recommend that you keep this id.
In case you want to disable adding this to your signed documents, turn the 'Disable DocumentId' switch on.

- Click the '⌄' symbol just beside your name on the top right corner
- Click profile
- Click the 'edit' button
- Turn the 'Disable DocumentId' swith to on
- Click 'save'
