### ✅ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds a second layer of security to your account by requiring **not just your password, but also a time-sensitive code** from a trusted device.

#### 🔐 What is 2FA?

2FA combines **something you know** (your password) with **something you have** (like a smartphone or hardware token). This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access—even if someone has your password.

#### 🛡️ Benefits:

- Enhances account protection against phishing and brute-force attacks  
- Reduces the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials  
- Helps meet compliance requirements for security-conscious organizations  
- Only the account owner with access to the authenticator app can log in  

#### 📲 How to Enable:

1. Go to **Settings > Preferences > Security**  
2. Click "Setup 2FA" button and scan the displayed QR code with an app like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator.
3. Save the recovery codes in a secure location (they allow access if you lose your phone)  
4. Enter the 6-digit verification code shown in your app to complete setup  

> 🔁 The verification code refreshes every 30 seconds and is unique to your device.  
> 🔐 If 2FA is enabled, you will be prompted for a verification code every time you log in.

### 🛡️ Passkey Authentication

Passkeys offer **passwordless**, **phishing-resistant**, and **device-bound** sign-in using modern authentication standards.

#### 🔐 What Are Passkeys?

Passkeys are cryptographic credentials tied to your device and identity, replacing traditional passwords. They’re based on **FIDO2/WebAuthn** standards and work using **public-private key encryption**, making them highly secure.

- Instead of typing passwords, you authenticate using biometrics (like Face ID or fingerprint) or a device PIN.
- A passkey is stored securely on your device and never shared—so even if attackers phish you, they can’t steal your login info.

#### 💡 Key Features:

- Use **fingerprint**, **Face ID**, or **device PIN**  
- **Passwordless** and **secure** authentication  
- Resistant to **phishing** and **credential stuffing**  
- Syncs across devices (when using platforms like iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager)  
- Fast, one-tap login experience

#### 🛠 How to Register a Passkey:

1. Go to **Settings > Preferences > Security**
2. Click **Register passkey**  
3. Your device prompts biometric or PIN-based authentication  
4. On success, the passkey is saved and listed under **Your Passkeys**

> 📌 A passkey is unique to each device/browser combination. You can register multiple passkeys for different environments.

#### 🧾 Managing Your Passkeys

##### ✏️ Rename:

Click the **pencil icon** to rename a passkey for easy identification.

##### 🗑 Delete:

Click the **trash icon** to remove a passkey.  
⚠️ This revokes access via that method and may require alternate login or re-registration.

> 🔐 Tip: Register multiple passkeys on different devices for redundancy and ease of access.
