| **Active**     | Toggle to activate or deactivate the team.                                   |

## 🌐 Where You Can Use the Teams

1. **Active teams** are available when creating new users — you can select a team from the dropdown and add multiple users under one team.

2. You can also **share templates** with teams. Once a template is shared with a team, **all users in that team can access the template**.

## 🚫 Deactivating a Team

To deactivate a team, toggle the **Active** switch off. This will:

- Prevent users in this team from logging into their OpenSign accounts.
- Hide the team from the **Teams dropdown** when adding new users.
- Prevent template sharing with deactivated teams.
- Preserve team data for future reactivation and audit purposes.

---

## ℹ️ Notes

- The **All Users** team is the default root and **cannot be deleted**.
- **Deactivated teams** can be re-enabled anytime using the toggle.
- Only users with **administrative privileges** can access and manage the Teams page.
