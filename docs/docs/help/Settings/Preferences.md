# 🔧 Preferences

The **Preferences** page in **OpenSign™** allows users and administrators to tailor the signing experience to suit individual, team, or organizational needs. Below is a breakdown of all configurable options and what they control.

---

## 📌 Signature Types Control

The **Allowed Signature Types** section defines which signature methods are available to signers:

- ✅ **Draw**: Create a handwritten signature using a mouse, stylus, or finger.
- ✅ **Type**: Type your name and apply it using pre-set font styles.
- ✅ **Upload**: Upload a scanned or saved image of your signature.
- ✅ **Default**: Use the default signature stored under *My Signature* in settings.

⚙️ The options selected here will determine what appears in the signature widget during the signing process.

## 🔄 Multi-Level Signature Type Control

**OpenSign™ v2.6.0** introduces flexible control over signature options at three levels:

### 📄 Document-Level
Set different signature types per document, ideal for adapting to specific legal or regulatory requirements.

### 👤 User-Level
Each user can define their preferred signature options, ensuring a familiar and consistent signing experience.

### 🏢 Organization-Level
Admins can enforce company-wide signing policies by restricting signature methods platform-wide.

> This layered control helps teams maintain compliance while optimizing usability.

## 🔔 Notify on Signatures

Enable or disable email or in-app notifications when a document is signed.

- **Yes** – Receive alerts for each completed signature.  
- **No** – Notifications are turned off.

**Details:**
The document creator will receive an email notification whenever a signer signs the document.  
**Note**: Regardless of this setting, a completion email with the signed document and completion certificate attached is always sent to all signers and the document owner.

---

## 📬 Send in Order

Decide whether the document should be signed sequentially or simultaneously by multiple signers.

- **Yes** – Signers receive the document in a set order.
- **No** – All signers receive the document at once.

**Details:**
Choose how you want the signing requests to be sent to the document signers:

- **Yes**: Sends the signing request to the first signer initially. Once the first signer completes their part, the next signer in the sequence receives the request. This continues until all signers have signed. This ensures the document is signed in a specific order.

- **No**: Sends signing links to all signers simultaneously. Each signer can sign at their convenience, regardless of whether others have signed. This method is faster but does not enforce any order.

Select the option that best suits your document processing needs.

---

## 🧭 Timezone & Date Format

Customize the **Timezone** and **Date Format** according to your regional preferences.

- Supports **12-hour** or **24-hour** time formats.
- Affects the timestamp shown on the platform and audit trails.

## 🧪 LTV Enabled Signatures (BETA)

Enable **Long-Term Validation (LTV)** to ensure the authenticity of the signature over time.  
*Currently in beta testing.*

---

## 🚫 Enable Tour

The tour feature provides guidance for first-time users. You can turn this off for a cleaner, uninterrupted experience:

- **Yes** – Show onboarding tips.
- **No** – Disable tour prompts *(recommended for experienced users)*.

**Details:**
- **Yes**: Enables a guided tour for signers, providing instructions during the signing process.
- **No**: Disables the guided tour, ensuring a faster, uninterrupted experience.

**Tip**: If your signers are familiar with OpenSign™ and use it frequently, disabling the tour can create a more seamless experience. Choose the option that best fits your document signing needs.
