# How to Create and Send a Document for Signature with OpenSign™

### Step 1: Begin New Document Creation

- **Navigate to Request Signatures form**: Start by navigating to 'Request Signatures' from the main menu to initiate the creation of a document for signatures.

### Step 2: Uploading Your Document

- **[2] Choose File**: Once the "Request signature" page opens, click here to select and upload the document file from your computer that needs to be signed.
- **[3] Choose File from Dropbox**: Click the dropbox icon to select the document file from your dropbox account.

### Step 3: Entering Document Details And Signers

- **[4] Title** *(Required)*: Input the title of your document. This identifier will be visible to signers and in your document management.
- **[5] Signers**: Use the dropdown to select existing signers or use the addition button to add a new signer who needs to sign the document. (Here, add the signer's details such as name, email, and phone number). 
- **[6] Note**: Optionally add a note to give context or instructions regarding the document.

### Step 4: Organizing Your Document

- **[7] Folder**: Select a folder where you want the document to be stored, or leave it to default to the 'Root' folder. You can browse your documents in a beautiful explorer view by navigating to "OpenSign™ Drive".

### Step 5: Setting the Time Frame

- **[8] Time To Complete (Days)** *(Required)*: Specify the number of days the signers have to complete the signatures. After that, the document will no longer be available for signing.

### Step 6: Set the sending order
- **[9] Send in Order**
  - **If you choose:**
  - **Yes**: Selecting this option will send the signing request to the first signer initially. Once the first signer completes their part, the next signer in the sequence will receive the request. This process continues until all signers have signed the document. This method ensures that the document is signed in a specific order.
  - **No**: Selecting this option will send the signing links to all signers simultaneously. Every signer can sign the document at their convenience, regardless of whether other signers have completed their signatures. This method is faster but does not enforce any signing order among the participants.
Select the option that best suits the needs of your document processing.
### Step 7: Auto reminder (feature only avilable for the subscribed user)
- **[10]** Once you enable the auto reminder, a text field will appear allowing you to set the reminder for a specific number of days.
- **Remind once in every (Days)**: Here, you can set the number of days for the reminder.
  
### Step 8: Proceed to Document Creation Panel
- **Next**: Once all the necessary fields are filled, click this button to proceed to create the document for signing.
- **Cancel**: If you need to start over or make changes, click this button to clear the form.
