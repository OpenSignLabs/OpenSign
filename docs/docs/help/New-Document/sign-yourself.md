## Interface Overview

# How to digitally sign a document using OpenSign™ for free?

OpenSign lets you digitally sign documents that don't need to be sent to anybody with ease. This feature is available in all the plans including **OpenSign free**. 
After login, you will be directed to the OpenSign dashboard. From the left-side menu, click on "Sign yourself" or by clicking the button on the Dashboard.

### Step 1: Uploading Your Document

- **[1] Choose File**: Once the "Sign Yourself" page opens, click here to upload the document you want to sign from your computer.
- **[2] Upload from Dropbox**: To upload a document directly from your Dropbox account, click the Dropbox icon. You may need to provide permissions to access the file when you do it for the first time.
  
```The maximum document size allowed is 10MB.```

### Step 2: Document Information

- **[1] Title** *(Required)*: Enter a title for your document. This will help you identify it later in OpenSign™.
- **[2] Note**: Provide an optional note for further context about the document.

### Step 3: Document Organization

- **[1] Folder**: Select a folder where you want the document to be stored, or leave it to default to the 'Root' folder. You can browse your documents in a beautiful explorer view by navigating to "OpenSign™ Drive".
- **[2] Root**: This is your default directory. Click the pencil icon to create or choose a different folder.
- **[3] Next**: After filling in all the required fields, click the "Next" button to proceed to the document creation panel.

- **[1] Add signature widget**: Once your document is loaded in the document creation panel, you will need to add a signature widget. OpenSign provides an intuitive interface for this task. Click on the signature widget and position it where the signature is required. You can add multiple signature widgets if needed.
After placing the Signature widget, a popup will appear for drawing the signature.
In the "Draw Signature" popup, you have three options available:

     -   Upload a digitally scanned signature.

     -   Type the signature using text input.
        
     -   Select your signature from "My Signature." (This option is available only if you have uploaded a signature under "My Signature" in Settings.)

- **[2] Add other widgets**: Depending on your needs, you can include additional widgets such as:
     - **Stamp**: After dragging and dropping the stamp widget, the "Upload Stamp Image" popup will appear, allowing you to upload an image from your file explorer. Once the stamp is uploaded, you will see the stamp image on the document. Additionally, alongside your stamp image, there is an option to copy the image. Clicking on the copy option presents three choices:
        - All pages : It will copy the stamp to all pages.
        - All pages but last: It will copy the stamp to all pages except the last page.
