# How to edit a document before sending in OpenSign™?

OpenSign™ lets you polish your PDF before you send it out—whether you’re signing it yourself, requesting signatures, or saving it as a template. You get four core editing controls right in the preview:

- **Add Pages**  
  In the left-side panel, users will see an **"Add" button**. Clicking it allows users to select and merge new documents into the current one.

- **Delete Page**  
  An option is available to **delete** any unwanted page from the document.

- **Reorder Pages**  
  Users can reorder pages by clicking the **"Reorder" button**, which opens a popup displaying all pages. Use the **Up** and **Down** arrows to change the order. Click **Save** to apply the new page order.
