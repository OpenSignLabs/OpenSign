# How to edit a document before sending in OpenSign™?

OpenSign™ lets you polish your PDF before you send it out—whether you’re signing it yourself, requesting signatures, or saving it as a template. You get three core editing controls right in the preview:

1. **Add Pages**

   * Click the **“+”** icon.
   * Upload one or more PDF files.
   * New pages are appended to the end of your current document.

2. **Rotate Pages**

   * Use the **left-rotate** or **right-rotate** icons on any page.
   * See the orientation update instantly in the real-time preview.

3. **Delete Pages**

   * Click the **trash bin** icon on the page you want to remove.
   * Confirm the deletion when prompted.
   * **Warning:** This action is permanent and cannot be undone.
