### Uploading Your Document

- **[1] Choose File**: Once the "New template" page opens, click here to select and upload the document file from your computer that needs to be signed. Supported formats include PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, and DOCX.
- **[2] Choose File from Dropbox**: Click the Dropbox icon to select the document file from your Dropbox account.

### Entering Template Details

- **[3] Title** *(Required)*: Provide a title for your template. For example, "Demo Custom Template."
- **[4] Description**: Optionally add a description to give context or instructions regarding the template. 
- **[5] Note**: Optionally add a note to give context or instructions regarding the document.

### Set the sending order
- **[6] Send in Order**
  - **If you choose:**
  - **Yes**: Selecting this option will send the signing request to the first signer initially. Once the first signer completes their part, the next signer in the sequence will receive the request. This process continues until all signers have signed the document. This method ensures that the document is signed in a specific order.
  - **No**: Selecting this option will send the signing links to all signers simultaneously. Every signer can sign the document at their convenience, regardless of whether other signers have completed their signatures. This method is faster but does not enforce any signing order among the participants.
Select the option that best suits the needs of your document processing.
### Auto reminder (feature only available for subscribed users)
- **[7]** Once you enable the auto reminder, a text field will appear allowing you to set the reminder for a specific number of days.
  - **Remind once in every (Days)**: Here, you can set the number of days for the reminder.

  Note: You can set a maximum of 15 reminders. For example, if the document completion time is 16 days and you try to schedule a reminder every day, the system will not allow it, as the reminder limit would be exceeded.
  
### Time to complete (days)
- **[8]** You can specify the number of days within which the document must be signed. For example, if you set the expiration period to 15 days, the created document will remain available for signing for 15 days from the date of creation. After this period, the document will expire, and the signer will no longer be able to sign it.

###  BCC
- **[9]** The BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) feature allows users to receive document completion emails at specified email addresses.
You can add multiple contacts in the BCC field to notify several recipients. 
You can either:
Click "Add New" to enter a new email contact, or
Select from existing contacts using the dropdown list.

### Security Setting
- **[10] Enable OTP Verification** :
  
If set to "Yes," the signer will be required to complete email OTP verification before viewing and signing the document. If "Enable OTP Verification" is set to "No," the signer will not be prompted for OTP verification during the signing process.
Note: This feature is available exclusively on paid plans.

### Enable tour:
  
- **[11]** If set to "Yes," the signer will see the tour guide while signing the document. If your signer is familiar with OpenSign and you prefer not to display the tour guide, you can select "No," and the tour guide will not be shown to your signers.

### Notify on signatures:
  
- **[12]** If set to "Yes," the document owner will receive an email notification each signer completes their signature.
Note: This feature is available exclusively on paid plans.

### Allow modifications: 

- **[13]** If set to Yes, the signer will be allowed to make modifications to the document during the signing process. However, they cannot edit or remove any fields that were already placed by the document owner. They can only add basic fields such as signature, stamp, initials, text, and cells.

If both Allow Modification and Enable OTP are set to Yes, the signer will still not be able to edit or delete existing fields, but will gain access to additional advanced fields to add during signing. These include: signature, stamp, initials, name, job title, company, text, cells, and email.

Note: This feature is available exclusively on paid plans.

### Redirect url:
