This process continues until all signers have signed the document. This method ensures that the document is signed in a specific order.
  - **No**: Selecting this option will send the signing links to all signers simultaneously. Every signer can sign the document at their convenience, regardless of whether other signers have completed their signatures. This method is faster but does not enforce any signing order among the participants.
