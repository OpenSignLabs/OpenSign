# How to Create a Template in OpenSign™

## Step 1: 
### Begin New Template Creation

### Uploading Your Document

- **[1] Choose File**: Once the "New template" page opens, click here to select and upload the document file from your computer that needs to be signed. Supported formats include PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, and DOCX.
- **[2] Choose File from Dropbox**: Click the dropbox icon to select the document file from your dropbox account.

### Entering Template Details

- **[3] Title** *(Required)*: Provide a title for your template. For example, "Demo Custom Template."
- **[4] Description**: Optionally add a description to give context or instructions regarding the template. 
- **[5] Note**: Optionally add a note to give context or instructions regarding the document.

### Set the sending order
- **[6] Send in Order**
  - **If you choose:**
  - **Yes**: Selecting this option will send the signing request to the first signer initially. Once the first signer completes their part, the next signer in the sequence will receive the request. This process continues until all signers have signed the document. This method ensures that the document is signed in a specific order.
  - **No**: Selecting this option will send the signing links to all signers simultaneously. Every signer can sign the document at their convenience, regardless of whether other signers have completed their signatures. This method is faster but does not enforce any signing order among the participants.
Select the option that best suits the needs of your document processing.
### Auto reminder (feature only available for the subscribed user)
- **[7]** Once you enable the auto reminder, a text field will appear allowing you to set the reminder for a specific number of days.
- **Remind once in every (Days)**: Here, you can set the number of days for the reminder.
### Security Setting
- **[8] Enable OTP Verification** : 
If set to "Yes," the signer will be required to complete email OTP verification before viewing and signing the document. If "Enable OTP Verification" is set to "No," the signer will not be prompted for OTP verification during the signing process.

- **[9] Enable tour**: 
If set to "Yes," the signer will see the tour guide while signing the document. If your signer is familiar with OpenSign and you prefer not to display the tour guide, you can select "No," and the tour guide will not be shown to your signers.

### Proceed to Template Creation Panel
- **Next**: Click the "Next" button to proceed to the next stage of template creation, where you can add widgets and finalize the template.
- **Cancel**: If you need to start over or make changes, click Cancel button to clear the form.
