### Viewing and Managing Templates 

On the Manage templates page you will see a list of templates you have created or have access to. The list includes details such as the template title, file, owner, signers, and whether the template is public.

**Download Template**: If you need to download the template file, click on the "Download" link under the "File" column next to the respective template.

**View Signers**: This will display the roles or the list of signers along with their assigned roles, if assigned during template creation.

**Public/Private Toggle**: You can set your template to public or private by toggling the switch under the "Public" column. Public templates can be accessed by anyone via the public URL, allowing them to open and sign the document after registering.

**Use Template**: To use a template, click the "+ USE" button next to the desired template. This will open the template, enabling you to create a document for a signature request. Simply assign the signers and send it for signatures.

**Bulk send**: This feature streamlines processing by allowing you to create and send multiple documents at once using a selected template. You can add multiple signers and generate all documents with a single click.

**Edit**: The "Edit" feature is crucial for keeping your document templates up-to-date and relevant. Whether you need to make minor tweaks or major changes, OpenSign's editing capabilities are user-friendly and efficient.
Click on the three dots next to the template you want to edit.
Select "Edit." Make the necessary changes and save them.

**Share With Team**: Collaboration is crucial for any successful workflow, and OpenSign makes it easy to share document templates with your team.
 - Click the three dots next to the template you wish to share.
 - Select "Share with Team" from the menu.
 - Choose the desired team from the list and click Submit.
   
The selected team members will now have access to the template and can use it to create documents.

  Note: Team members will have view and usage-only access to the shared template — they cannot edit or delete it. 
  This feature is available exclusively on Teams and Enterprise plans.
  
**Share With colleague**: OpenSign also allows you to share templates with individual colleagues for efficient collaboration.
 - Click the three dots next to the template you wish to share.

 - Select "Share with Colleague" from the menu.

 - Choose the user from the list and click Submit.

The selected user will be able to access the template and create documents from it.

**Embed**: The "Embed" option provides you with a code to embed the template into a website or other platforms, allowing users to interact with it directly from the external site.
Click "Embed" to generate the code that can be copied and pasted into your desired web location. We currently support React, HTML/JavaScript and Angular-based websites.

**Copy template id**: This action copies the unique ID associated with the template, which is useful for embedding or sharing with public users when your template is set to public.

**Copy public URL**: This generates a public link for the template, allowing external users to access it without logging into OpenSign.
Click "Copy Public URL" to generate the link, then share it as needed.

**Kiosk Mode**: Kiosk Mode offers a simplified and secure environment for signers to complete documents on a shared or public device. It's ideal for use cases like front-desk sign-ins, in-office document execution, or on-site registrations where multiple individuals need to sign documents one after another.

When you click the Kiosk Mode option along with a selected template, the document opens in a dedicated signing interface. Signers can then complete their portions sequentially on the same screen and device, ensuring a smooth and efficient signing flow without requiring individual logins.
Note: This feature is available exclusively on Teams and Enterprise plans.

**Duplicate**: When you need to create a copy of an existing template, use the Duplicate option. This feature allows you to quickly generate an exact replica of the selected template, making it easy to reuse and modify without affecting the original.

**Delete**: Sometimes, it's necessary to clean up your templates to keep your workspace organized. The "Delete" feature allows you to remove outdated or unnecessary templates with ease.
Click on the three dots next to the template you want to delete.
Select "Delete." Confirm the deletion.
