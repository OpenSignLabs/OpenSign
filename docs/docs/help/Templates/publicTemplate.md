# What is the OpenSign Public profile?

The OpenSign Public profile feature offers the ultimate public document signing solution without any need for integrations. With this feature, users can share document templates publicly, allowing anyone to access and sign the documents directly through the shared templates. This streamlines the signing process by providing a seamless, accessible way for public signers to complete documents without additional steps or integrations.

  - **[2] Add other widgets**: Depending on your needs, you can include additional widgets such as:
Stamps, Initials, Name, Date, Text, Checkbox, and more.

**Important**: Before proceeding, ensure that all roles have assigned signers, except for the public role, since we are making this template public.

### Save template
