- **[1] Define Roles**:
  - **Add Roles**: In the roles section on the right, click "+ Add role" to specify the roles involved in the document, such as Candidate, HR, and Manager.

    **Note**: Make sure the public role is positioned at the top if 'Send in Order' is set to Yes; otherwise, you will be prompted to make the template public.
    
- **[2] Assign Widgets to Roles**: Click on each role to highlight it, then drag and drop the widget to assign it to that role.
  - **[1] Assign signature widget**: Select the Role from the right side panel, click on the signature widget, and position it where the signature is required. You can place multiple signature widgets for each Role, as required.
  - **[2] Add other widgets**: Depending on your needs, you can include additional widgets such as:
Stamps, Initials, Name, Date, Text, Checkbox, and more.

**Important**: Before proceeding, ensure that all roles have assigned signers, except for the public role, since we are making this template public.
### Save Template 
**Next button**: Once you’ve organized your widgets and set their properties, simply click the “Next” button to save your template.

After doing so, a “Create Document” popup will appear, prompting you with the question: “Do you want to create a document using the template you just created?” You’ll have the option to choose either “Yes” or “No.”

Choose "No" you will be redirected to the Manage templates.

## Step 4: 
### Managing and making template public

On the Manage Templates page, you'll see a list of templates you've created or have access to. This list provides details such as the template title, file, owner, signers, and whether the template is public.

To make a template public, click the toggle button in the public column on the template.

A public profile popup will appear, where you can copy the public URL.

Copy and share this link, and anyone with it can view your publicly available templates by pasting the URL into their browser.

## Step 5: 
### Sign the document through the public template.

  - Click the Sign Now button next to the template you want to sign. Once the document loads, click Sign Now in the top right corner. A popup will appear asking for signer details such as Name, Email, and Phone Number.

  - Enter the required details and click Submit.

  - You can now fill in the necessary fields within the document's widgets and sign it.
    
  - After you finish signing, the document will be completed and automatically sent to the next signer for their signature.

## Step 6:

## Additional Information
