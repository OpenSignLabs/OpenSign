## Understanding the Contactbook report
### Adding a New Contact:

To add a new contact, click the red plus (+) button located at the top-right corner of the Contactbook page. 
This will open a pop-up where you can enter the contact’s name, email, and phone number.

The Contactbook page displays a list of contacts with the following columns:

- **Sr.No**: A sequential number for each contact.
- **Name**: The contact's name.
- **Email**: The contact’s email address.
- **Phone**: The contact’s phone number (if available).

### Import contacts:
OpenSign provides the feature to import contacts in bulk using an Excel or CSV file.
Click the Import button located at the top-right corner. A popup will appear allowing you to upload your file. You can also download a sample file, add your contacts to it, and then upload it.
Once imported, the contacts will be added to your list. Duplicate entries—based on email ID—will be skipped automatically.
