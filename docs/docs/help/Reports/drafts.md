3. Select **"Drafts"** under the Reports section. This will display all your saved draft documents.

### Understanding the Draft documents report

The Draft documents section provides an organized list of all documents that are saved as drafts. Each draft entry contains key details that help you quickly identify and manage your documents. Here’s a breakdown of the information available:

- **Sr.No:** This column displays the serial number for each document in the list, helping you quickly identify and reference documents.

- **Title:** The "Title" column displays the name of the document.
  
- **Note:** This section contains any notes that were added during the document's creation.

- **Folder:** The "Folder" column indicates the location where the document is stored within OpenSign Drive, ensuring you can easily locate the document later.

- **File:** Here, you will find a **"Download"** link that allows you to directly download the drafted document to your local device for review or archiving.

- **Owner:** This column shows the name of the person who created the document.

- **Signers:** The "Signers" column displays the names and email addresses of the signers assigned to that document for signature. Click the "View" button to see the signers.

### Action buttons

The "Draft documents" report also includes several actions icons for each document:

- **Edit:** If you need to make changes to your draft, click the edit (pencil) icon. This will open the document for you to make the necessary modifications before sending it for signatures.

- **Delete:** If a draft is no longer needed, click the trash icon to delete it. Be cautious when using this action as deleted drafts cannot be recovered.
  
- **Save as template:** This option allows the user to save the current document as a reusable template. Upon clicking, a confirmation popup will appear. If the user selects Yes, the template will be created successfully. After that, the user will be presented with options to Use Template, Send in Bulk, or Edit the Template. The newly created template will also be available in the Manage Templates list.
