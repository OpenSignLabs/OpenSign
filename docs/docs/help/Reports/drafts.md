- **Sr.No:** This column displays the serial number for each document in the list, helping you quickly identify and reference documents.

- **Title:** The "Title" column displays the name of the document.
  
- **Note:** This section contains any notes that were added during the document's creation.

- **Folder:** The "Folder" column indicates the location where the document is stored within OpenSign Drive, ensuring you can easily locate the document later.

- **File:** Here, you will find a **"Download"** link that allows you to directly download the drafted document to your local device for review or archiving.

- **Owner:** This column shows the name of the person who created the document.

- **Signers:** The "Signers" column displays the names and email addresses of the signers assigned to that document for signature. Click the "View" button to see the signers.

### Action buttons

The "Draft documents" report also includes several actions icons for each document:

- **Edit:** If you need to make changes to your draft, click the edit (pencil) icon. This will open the document for you to make the necessary modifications before sending it for signatures.

- **Delete:** If a draft is no longer needed, click the trash icon to delete it. Be cautious when using this action as deleted drafts cannot be recovered.
