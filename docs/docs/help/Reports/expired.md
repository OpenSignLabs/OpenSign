## Managing Expired documents

Managing your expired documents effectively can help ensure that no important document is overlooked. Consider the following tips:

- **Review Regularly**: Check the Expired documents report periodically to manage documents that require attention.
- **Follow Up**: Contact the signers who have not completed their signatures informing them about the expired documents and resend the documents if necessary.

By keeping track of your expired documents, you can maintain a clear overview of your document workflows & ensure that all the necessary actions are taken on time.
