### Action buttons

For each expired document, you can perform several actions:

- **View**: Opens the document in a viewer within OpenSign, allowing you to review the details and contents of the document.

## Managing Expired documents

Managing your expired documents effectively can help ensure that no important document is overlooked. Consider the following tips:

- **Review Regularly**: Check the Expired documents report periodically to manage documents that require attention.
- **Follow Up**: Contact the signers who have not completed their signatures informing them about the expired documents and resend the documents if necessary.
- **Archive**: Move documents that are no longer active or needed to an archive folder to keep your workspace organized.

By keeping track of your expired documents, you can maintain a clear overview of your document workflows & ensure that all the necessary actions are taken on time.
