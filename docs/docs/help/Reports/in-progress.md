# Understanding the "In-Progress Documents" Report
The In-Progress Documents report in OpenSign helps you monitor and manage documents that are currently in the signing process. This report enables you to monitor the status of your documents, manually share the document URL, track document progress, resend reminders, revoke access, or delete documents that are no longer required. Here’s a detailed guide on how to use the In-Progress Documents report effectively.

### Navigating to the In-Progress Documents Report

1. Once logged into OpenSign, you'll see a navigation panel on the left side of your screen.
2. Click on **"Reports"** to expand the available options.
3. Select **"In Progress"** This will display all documents that are currently awaiting signatures or are otherwise in the signing process.

### Understanding the In-Progress Documents Report

The "In Progress Documents" report is displayed in a tabular format, presenting key information about each finalized document. Below is a breakdown of each column and its purpose:

- **Sr.No:** This column displays the serial number for each document in the list, helping you quickly identify and reference documents.

- **Title:** The "Title" column displays the name of the document.
  
- **Note:** This section contains any notes that were added during the document's creation process.

- **Folder:** The "Folder" column indicates the location where the document is stored within OpenSign Drive, ensuring you can easily locate the document later.

- **File:** Here, you will find a **"Download"** link that allows you to directly download the In-progress document to your local device for review.

- **Owner:** This column shows the name of the person who created the document.

- **Signers:** The "Signers" column displays the names and email addresses of the signers assigned to that document for signature. Click the "View" button to see the signers.

### Action buttons

The "In progress Documents" report also includes several actions icons for each document:

- **Share Document:** The "Share" option in the In-Progress Documents report allows you to manually share the signing link of a document with signers or other recipients directly via email. This feature ensures that the signers can easily access the document, even if they have missed the initial notification.

Upon clicking the Share icon, a pop-up window titled Copy link will appear. This window provides multiple options to share the document link with designated recipients. Here’s how to use the options within this pop-up:
The pop-up will display a list of email addresses of the intended recipients or signers of the document. Each email corresponds to a person who needs access to the document.

- 
   - **Share Button:** Click the Share button next to the recipient’s email address to resend the document link directly to that individual. This action provides multiple sharing options, such as copying the link, or sharing it via Outlook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and more.

  - **Copy Button:** Click the Copy button next to the email address to copy the unique signing link to your clipboard. You can then paste this link manually into an email, chat, or any other preferred method of communication to share with the recipient.

- **View Document:** The eye icon lets you preview the document directly within OpenSign without downloading it. Here, you can view the document's exact status, including who has signed and how many signers are still pending.

- **Resend:** If a signer has not responded or needs a reminder, use the resend option to send another notification. This ensures that the signing process continues without delay.

- **Revoke:** If there’s a mistake or you need to cancel the document, revoking stops all signing actions immediately. This is useful when changes are needed before re-sending the document.

- **Delete :** If the document is outdated or was sent by mistake, you can permanently remove it from the list. Use this action cautiously, as deleted documents cannot be recovered.
