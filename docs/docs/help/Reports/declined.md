- **Sr.No:** This column displays the serial number for each document in the list, helping you quickly identify and reference documents.

- **Title:** The "Title" column displays the name of the document.
  
- **Reason:** This section contains the reasons for declining the document.

- **Folder:** The "Folder" column indicates the location where the document is stored within OpenSign Drive, ensuring you can easily locate the document later.

- **File:** Here, you will find a **"Download"** link that allows you to directly download the completed document to your local device for review or archiving.

- **Owner:** This column shows the name of the person who created the document.

- **Signers:** The "Signers" column displays the names and email addresses of the signers assigned to that document for signature. Click the "View" button to see the signers

### Action buttons

The "Declined documents" report also includes several action icons for each document:

- **View Document:** The eye icon allows you to preview the document directly within OpenSign without needing to download it.
- **Delete Document:** The trash bin icon enables you to permanently delete a document from your declined list. Be cautious, as this action cannot be undone.
- **Save as template:** This option allows the user to save the current document as a reusable template. Upon clicking, a confirmation popup will appear. If the user selects Yes, the template will be created successfully. After that, the user will be presented with options to Use Template, Send in Bulk, or Edit the Template. The newly created template will also be available in the Manage Templates list.
  
- **Fix and resend:** This option allows the user to recreate a document that was previously declined.
It is useful when the declined document has missing or incorrect information. Instead of creating a new one from scratch, the user can make the necessary edits and resend it for signature.
