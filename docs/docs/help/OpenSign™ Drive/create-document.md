### 3. Creating a New Document
To create a document for self-signing or by requesting a signature, you can do so by selecting the appropriate option from OpenSign Drive.

**Step 1:** Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner of OpenSign Drive.  
**Step 2:** This time, choose "Sign Yourself" or "Request Signatures" depending on whether you want to sign the document yourself or send it to others for their signatures.  
**Step 3:** When you select the "Sign Yourself" or "Request Signature" option, the document creation page will open, allowing you to enter details such as the document title, description, notes, and other necessary information. You can also choose an OpenSign Drive folder to store your document. Once you’ve selected the folder and created the document, it will be saved in that folder, making it easily accessible from your OpenSign Drive.

### 6. Filter and Sort Documents in OpenSign Drive

- **Sorting Documents by Name:**
To sort your documents alphabetically:

1. Click on the "Date" dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the OpenSign Drive interface.
2. Select "Name" from the dropdown list. This will arrange your documents alphabetically by their titles.
3. You can then choose to order them in ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A) order by toggling the "Ascending" or "Descending" option.

- **Sorting Documents by Date:**
If you prefer to sort your documents based on when they were created or modified:

1. Click the "Date" dropdown menu in the top right corner.
2. Ensure that "Date" is selected. This will organize your documents based on their creation or modification date.
3. Select "Ascending" to arrange documents from the oldest to the newest, or choose "Descending" to list them from the newest to the oldest.

- **Ascending vs. Descending Order**
- **Ascending Order:** Whether sorting by name or date, selecting "Ascending" will arrange your documents from A to Z (if sorting by name) or from oldest to newest (if sorting by date).
- **Descending Order:** Choosing "Descending" will reverse the order, arranging documents from Z to A (by name) or from newest to oldest (by date).

These sorting features help you keep your documents organized, making it easier to locate specific files quickly, especially when you have a large number of documents stored in your OpenSign Drive.
