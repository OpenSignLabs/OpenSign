To create a document for self-signing or by requesting a signature, you can do so by selecting the appropriate option from OpenSign Drive.

**Step 1:** Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner of OpenSign Drive.  
**Step 2:** This time, choose "Sign Yourself" or "Request Signatures" depending on whether you want to sign the document yourself or send it to others for their signatures.

You can also choose an OpenSign Drive folder to store your document. Once you’ve selected the folder and created the document, it will be saved in that folder, making it easily accessible from your OpenSign Drive.

OpenSign Drive offers a variety of tools to help you manage your documents efficiently, one of the most useful being the Status Indicators system.

**Status Indicators** 

These indicators are represented by different icons on your documents, allowing you to instantly recognize their current status:

- **Signed (Green Check Mark):** This icon signifies that the document has been fully signed and is complete.
- **Pending Signature (Yellow Paper Airplane):** Documents with this icon are awaiting signatures from one or more parties.
- **Draft (Blue Paper Clip):** A Blue Paper Clip indicates that the document is in draft form and has not yet been sent out for signatures.
- **Declined document (Red Exclamation Mark):** This icon highlights documents that require immediate action, indicating that the document has been declined.
- **Expired (Gray Hourglass):** A gray hourglass indicates that the document is expired.

### 6. Filter and Sort Documents in OpenSign Drive
OpenSign Drive provides a powerful and easy-to-use interface for managing your documents. To help you quickly find and organize your files, OpenSign Drive offers several sorting and filtering options, allowing you to arrange your documents by name or date, in either ascending or descending order.

- **Sorting Documents by Name:**
To sort your documents alphabetically:

1. Click on the Sort dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the OpenSign Drive interface.
2. Select "Name" from the dropdown list. This will arrange your documents alphabetically by their titles.
3. You can then choose to order them in ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A) order by toggling the "Ascending" or "Descending" option.

- **Sorting Documents by Date:**
If you prefer to sort your documents based on when they were created or modified:

1. Click the Sort dropdown menu in the top right corner.
2. Ensure that "Date" is selected. This will organize your documents based on their creation or modification date.
3. Select "Ascending" to arrange documents from the oldest to the newest, or choose "Descending" to list them from the newest to the oldest.

- **Ascending vs. Descending Order**
- **Ascending Order:** Whether sorting by name or date, selecting "Ascending" will arrange your documents from A to Z (if sorting by name) or from oldest to newest (if sorting by date).
- **Descending Order:** Choosing "Descending" will reverse the order, arranging documents from Z to A (by name) or from newest to oldest (by date).

These sorting features help you keep your documents organized, making it easier to locate specific files quickly, especially when you have a large number of documents stored in your OpenSign Drive.
