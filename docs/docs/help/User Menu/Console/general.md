# General

The **General** section in OpenSign includes essential settings that allow the admin to manage and control the overall configuration of the OpenSign platform.

---

## Enabled Signature Types

Admins can define which signature types are available at the organization level.  

All users under your account will only see the signing methods you enable here in their **Preferences**. They will not be able to use any signature methods that are disabled by the admin.

**Example:**  
Adam, the administrator of your company account, disables the **Typed** signature option in the **Manage Signature Types** settings. As a result, Ursula, a team member, will no longer see the **Typed** signature option in her preferences.

Ursula can still enable or disable any of the remaining signature methods for each document she creates.  
When she sends a document to Sofia (a signer), Sofia will only see the signature methods that Ursula selected during the document creation process.

> **Note:** Managing **Signature Types** at the organization level is available only on the **Teams** plan.  
> This feature is not included in the **Professional** or **Free** plans.

## Allow Indexing of Public Profile

If this option is enabled, the user’s public profile will be indexed and appear in search results.

## Email Template Customization

This setting allows the admin to control whether users can create and manage their own email templates.

- If the admin **disables** this setting, team users **cannot** create custom email templates for request signatures or document completion notifications.  
- If the setting is **enabled**, users can customize their own individual templates.
