# 🏢 Organizations

The **Organizations** section in **OpenSign** allows administrators to create and manage **separate groups** within a **Team or Enterprise account**.  
Each organization acts as an **independent workspace** with its **own users, teams, templates, and signing workflows**.

## 🧩 What Are Organizations in OpenSign?

An **Organization** represents a **distinct sub-account** under your main (team or enterprise) OpenSign account.  
Organizations are completely **isolated** from each other — meaning:

- Teams and users from one organization **cannot view or access** teams, documents, or users from another organization.  
- Each organization functions as its own **secure workspace** within your overall account.  
- You can manage multiple organizations from a **single admin console**, ensuring centralized control.

### 💼 Example Use Case

If your company manages multiple **clients or departments**, each with its own teams and sub-users, the **Organizations** feature is perfect for you.

For example:
- An agency can create **individual sub-accounts** for each client (Client A, Client B, etc.).
- Each client’s team members and workflows remain **private and independent**.
- The **main admin (enterprise account holder)** retains full control and visibility from the console.

> 💰 **Billing:** All organizations under the same account are billed centrally by the **primary account holder**.  
> This ensures simplified management and unified subscription handling.

## ⚙️ Manage Organizations

The **Organizations table** lists all existing organizations with the following details:

- **Sr.No** — Serial number of the organization.  
- **Name** — The registered name of the organization.  
- **IsActive** — Toggle to activate or deactivate the organization.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Deactivating an organization disables all its associated users and workflows until it is reactivated.
