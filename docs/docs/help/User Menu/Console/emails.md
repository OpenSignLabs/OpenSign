## ✉️ Request Signature Email

This email is automatically sent to all signers when a document is shared for signing.

- Customize the **subject line**, **greeting**, **message body**, and **footer** to match your brand’s tone and style.  
- Use dynamic placeholders like `{{document_title}}`, `{{receiver_name}}`, and `{{signing_url}}` for personalization.  
- Personalized messages increase open rates and help recipients clearly understand the signing request.

## 📩 Document Completion Email

This email is sent to all signers and the document owner once the signing process is successfully completed.

- Contains a summary message along with the **signed document** and **completion certificate** as attachments.  
- Customizing this template helps maintain brand consistency even in post-signature communications.  
- Ideal for sharing **legal confirmations**, **audit trails**, or **record-keeping** updates.

### 🔄 Reset Template Text

## 🛠️ Additional Notes

- All custom email templates support **rich text formatting** and **dynamic variables**.  
- Updates take effect immediately and apply to **all new documents** created after the change.  
- Organizations can enforce consistent branding and compliance across all user emails.  
- If no custom email template is configured, and users are not allowed to create individual templates, OpenSign will automatically use the **OpenSign default email templates**.

> 💡 **Tip:** Always preview your templates before saving to ensure correct formatting and placeholder usage.
