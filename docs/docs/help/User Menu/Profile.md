### üîñ Disable DocumentId  

Whenever a document is signed by all parties, **OpenSign‚Ñ¢ automatically adds a unique DocumentId** at the top-left corner of the signed document.  

This ID can be used later to **verify the authenticity of the document**, so we **strongly recommend keeping it enabled**.  

If you prefer not to include the DocumentId in your signed documents, simply toggle the **Disable DocumentId** switch **ON**.

> **Note:** This feature is available only for paid users.

### Language
