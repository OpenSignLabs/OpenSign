import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

## Steps to run OpenSign™ with docker on Linux/MacOS/Windows:

### Step 1. Download and Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/):

Follow the official Docker installation guide based on your operating system.

Create a Docker Hub account if you don't already have one.

**Important:** Don't forget to verify your Docker Hub account via the email verification link. If you skip this step, the deployment might fail due to unauthorized access errors when pulling Docker images.

### Step 2. Open the terminal and execute the below commands as per your operating system. 

Make sure Docker is running in the background before proceeding.

**Warning:** The commands below should only be used when installing OpenSign for the first time. You may loose your settings as this will overwrite .env & caddy files.

### Running on a custom domain
Command for linux/MacOS 
```
export HOST_URL=https://opensign.yourdomain.com && curl --remote-name-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/Caddyfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/.env.local_dev && mv .env.local_dev .env.prod && docker compose up --force-recreate
```
Command for Windows (**Powershell**)
```
$env:HOST_URL="https://opensign.yourdomain.com"; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/docker-compose.yml -OutFile docker-compose.yml; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/Caddyfile -OutFile Caddyfile; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/.env.local_dev -OutFile .env.local_dev; Rename-Item -Path .env.local_dev -NewName .env.prod; docker compose up --force-recreate
```
Command for Windows (**CMD/Terminal**)
```
set HOST_URL=https://opensign.yourdomain.com && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/docker-compose.yml && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/Caddyfile && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/.env.local_dev && rename .env.local_dev .env.prod && docker compose up --force-recreate
```
 
Copy the command above, paste it into the terminal, and press Enter to pull and start the containers automatically. 

Make sure to replace the host URL with your subdomain where OpenSign will be accessible. 

You will also need to point the subdomain to the server executing these commands by adding the correct A record to your DNS settings.
  
### Running locally
If instead want to run locally try out below commands.
  
Command for linux/MacOS (localhost)
```
curl --remote-name-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/Caddyfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/.env.local_dev && mv .env.local_dev .env.prod && docker compose up --force-recreate
```
Command for Windows (**Powershell**) (localhost)
```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/docker-compose.yml -OutFile docker-compose.yml; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/Caddyfile -OutFile Caddyfile; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/.env.local_dev -OutFile .env.local_dev; Rename-Item -Path .env.local_dev -NewName .env.prod; docker compose up --force-recreate
```
Command for Windows (**CMD/Terminal**) (localhost)
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/docker-compose.yml && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/Caddyfile && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign/main/.env.local_dev && rename .env.local_dev .env.prod && docker compose up --force-recreate
```

Once the deployment is successful, the application will be accessible at [https://localhost:3001](https://localhost:3001). You will need to accept Chrome's insecure certificate warning. Follow the steps in the screenshots to proceed.

## Information About ENV variables which are used to setup OpenSign™ with Docker on Localhost
To set up OpenSign™ locally using Docker, the following prerequisites are required: 

Add below Environment Varaibles to the ".env.prod" file that is automatically created in order to personalize your installation:

| Environment Varibale  | Value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| PUBLIC_URL  | https://localhost:3001 or https://opensign.yourdomain.com  | Set it to the URL form where the app home page will be accessed |
| APP_ID  | opensign  | A 12 character long random app identifier. |
| MASTER_KEY  | XnAadwKxxByMr  | A 12 character long random secret key that allows access to all the data. It is used in Parse dashboard config to view all the data in the database. |
| MONGODB_URI  | mongodb://mongo-container:27017/OpenSignDB  | Mongodb URI to connect to |
| PARSE_MOUNT  | /app  | Path on which APIs should be mounted. Do not change this. This variable shall be removed & value hardcoded in the source code in coming versions. |
| SERVER_URL  | http://localhost:8080/app  | Set it to the URL from where APIs will be accessible to the NodeJS functions, for local development it should be localhost:8080/app|
| DO_SPACE  | DOSPACENAME  | Digital ocean space name or AWS S3 bucket name for uploading documents |
| DO_ENDPOINT  | ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com  | Digital ocean spaces endpoint or AWS S3 endpoint for uploading documents |

# Steps to Generate Self Sign Certificate
```
# execute below command and use passphrase 'opensign'
openssl genrsa -des3 -out ./local_dev.key 2048
openssl req -key ./local_dev.key -new -x509 -days 365 -out ./local_dev.crt
openssl pkcs12 -inkey ./local_dev.key -in ./local_dev.crt -export -out ./local_dev.pfx
openssl base64 -in ./local_dev.pfx -out ./base64_pfx
```
Please note that when signing a document using a certificate generated through this process, it won’t be recognized as valid by Adobe Acrobat. To get the green tick on your signed documents, you'll need to purchase a document signing certificate (a p12 certificate in pfx format) from an [AATL-approved Certificate Authority](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list1.html).

# CORS Configuration

As document storage is delegated to S3-compatible services that reside in a different host than the OpenSign one, document operations (loading, storing, deleting) are subject to [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) restriction policies; as a consequence, OpenSign app may fail with (browser console) errors like the following:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://foo.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/exported_file_4627_0000-00-00T00%3A45%3A43.344Z.pdf'
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header
is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to
'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```

In order to address this, your document storage system must be instructed to accept requests from other hosts; below the relevant documentation links:
- [How to Configure CORS on DigitalOcean Spaces](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/configure-cors/)
- [Configuring cross-origin resource sharing on AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enabling-cors-examples.html)
